tn5250 macOS README
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This file contains installation and configuration instructions and notes
specific to the macOS platform.

TERMINAL CONFIGURATION
======================

macOS Terminal.app and iTerm2 support most of the function keys needed for
tn5250 out of the box. However, to get the full 5250 experience with all
24 function keys, you need to install the custom terminfo entry.

INSTALLING TERMINFO
==================

To install the 5250 terminfo entry on macOS, run the following command as
a user with appropriate permissions:

   tic 5250.terminfo

This will compile and install the terminfo entry to your system's terminfo
database (usually /usr/share/terminfo/).

USING THE TERMINAL
==================

After installing the terminfo entry, you can use tn5250 by setting your
TERM environment variable:

   export TERM=5250

Or for X11/XQuartz terminals:

   export TERM=xterm-5250

FUNCTION KEY MAPPING
===================

The following function keys are supported:

F1-F12:  Standard function keys
F13-F24: Accessed via Shift+F1 through Shift+F12 (terminal dependent)

Some terminals may require additional configuration:

Terminal.app:
- Go to Preferences > Profiles > Keyboard
- Enable "Use Option as Meta key" if needed
- Function keys F1-F12 work by default
- F13-F24 may require Shift+Fn+F1-F12

iTerm2:
- Go to Preferences > Profiles > Keys
- Function keys work by default
- Better support for F13-F24 via Shift+F1-F12

HOMEBREW INSTALLATION
====================

If you installed tn5250 via Homebrew, the terminfo files may be installed
automatically. Check if the 5250 terminfo is available:

   infocmp 5250

If not found, manually install using the tic command above.

TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

If you experience issues with function keys:

1. Verify your TERM variable is set correctly
2. Check that the terminfo entry is installed: infocmp 5250
3. Test function keys in your terminal emulator
4. Consider using iTerm2 for better compatibility

For X11 applications (XQuartz), use TERM=xterm-5250 instead of TERM=5250.
