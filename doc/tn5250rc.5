.TH TN5250RC 5 "12 November 2001"
.SH NAME
tn5250rc \- tn5250 and lp5250d configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B tn5250rc
file contains groups of options for
.B tn5250
and
.BR lp5250d .
When a hostname is passed to one of these programs, the named group is
looked up in
.BR tn5250rc ,
and any options given in that group are processed.
.PP
If a named group is found, and defines a
.B host
option, that option specifies the server. Otherwise, the host
parameter to the program is used.
.PP
A group of options looks like this:
.PP
    \fIgroupname\fR {
        +\fIboolean\fR
        \fIoption\fR=\fIvalue\fR
        \fI...\fR
    }
.PP
Each group of options starts with the group name, followed by a left
brace (curly bracket) character. Following lines should have one
option on each line. The last line of the group has a single right
brace.
.PP
The global
.B tn5250rc
file may be overridden by the user's
.B ~/.tn5250rc
file.
.SH OPTIONS
The options given here may be used inside a section of the
configuration file, or on the
.B tn5250
or
.B lp5250d
command line.  Most options take the form
.IR OPTION = VALUE .
Options listed with a leading
.BR + / \-
can be either turned on
.RI ( +OPTION )
or off
.RI ( \-OPTION ).
.SS Common Options
These options apply to both printer and display emulation sessions.
.TP
.BI host= URL
Set the host to connect to.  The
.I URL
is of the form
.RI [\| PROTOCOL :\|]\| HOSTNAME \|[\|: PORT \|].
The default protocol, if not supplied, is
.BR tn5250 .
See
.B Protocols
below for descriptions of the available protocols.
.TP
.BI map= CCSID
Set the translation table between ASCII and EBCDIC.  This should match
the CCSID of the interactive job.  The default is
.BR 37 .
See
.B "Translation Maps"
below for more information.
.TP
.BI env.DEVNAME= NAME
Set the device name for the AS/400 to assign to the 5250 session.
This should be up to ten characters long and consist of only letters
and numbers.  It will be converted to uppercase and used as the name
of the 5250-compatible device on the AS/400.  There may only be one
session active with any given name at one time.
.TP
.BI trace= TRACEFILE
Log all actions to
.IR TRACEFILE .
This file will get very large, and may contain sensitive information
such as the password used to log in.
.TP
.BR + / \-ssl_verify_server
If set, then verify that the server's certificate was issued by a CA
in the file given by the
.B ssl_ca_file
option. If the certificate's issuer cannot be verified, do not connect
to the server.
.TP
.BI ssl_ca_file= CAFILE
Specify the file containing the certificate for the CA that issued the
server's certificate. If the server certificate is self-signed,
.I CAFILE
should contain the certificate displayed by the
.B "Digital Certificate Manager"
option
.IR "Copy and paste certificate" .
.TP
.BI ssl_cert_file= CERTFILE
Specify the file containing the personal certificate, in PEM
format. This must be a certificate associated with your user profile
on the AS/400 by
.BR DCM .
.TP
.BI ssl_pem_pass= PASSWORD
If the personal certificate given by
.B ssl_cert_file
is password protected, the password may be given here to bypass the
password prompt.
.SS Display Options
These options are specific to
.B tn5250
and
.BR xt5250 .
.TP
.BR + / \-underscores
Force or disable the use of underscore characters instead of the underline
attribute, for terminals that do not support underlining but where
.B tn5250
does not work this out itself.
.TP
.BR + / \-ruler
Turn the ruler feature on or off.  When enabled, the row and column of
the cursor will be highlighted.
.TP
.BR + / \-mouse
Turns on using the mouse automatically to move the cursor. The wheel can be
used to roll up and down as well. You can toggle usage of mouse reporting
(for example, to turn it off to select text instead) by pressing C-v.
.TP
.BI env.TERM= MODEL
Set the terminal model name for the emulation session to use.  The
default depends on whether the terminal supports colour, and whether
it is large enough to support the large terminal size.  See
.B "Display Types"
below for valid model names.
.IP
The default model emulated is an
.BR IBM-3179-2 ,
a 24x80 colour terminal.
.TP
.BI font_80= FONT
If
.B tn5250
is running in an xterm, sets the font to change to when the terminal
is in 80 column mode.  This should be a valid X font name, such as can
be chosen with
.BR xfontsel .
.TP
.BI font_132= FONT
If the emulated terminal has a size of 27x132, set the font to use in
132 column mode, as for the
.B font_80
option.
.TP
.BI beep_command= COMMAND
If present, will run the supplied command instead of using the terminal beep.
.TP
.BR + / \-uninhibited
If enabled, automatically resets the input inhibited state when cursor
movement keys or function keys are pressed.  The default is enabled.
.TP
.BI env. VARIABLE = VALUE
Set any other environment variables controlling the terminal session.
A list of relevant variables is given in section 5 of
.BR RFC2877 .
.SS "Printer Options"
.TP
.BI outputcommand= COMMAND
Set the command that will be run to receive printer output.  The
default command is
.RB ` "scs2ascii |lpr" '.
.TP
.BI env.IBMMFRTYPMDL= NAME
Set the name of the host print transform description to use on the
AS/400.  This is the same as the MFRTYPMDL parameter on the CRTDEVPRT
command.  See the CL Reference or the online help for a list of valid
values.
.TP
.BI env. VARIABLE = VALUE
Set any other environment variables controlling the printer session.
A list of relevant variables is given in section 7 of
.BR RFC2877 .
More generally, the variables are the parameters of the
.B CRTDEVPRT
command, with a prefix of
.BR IBM .
.SH "OPTION VALUES"
.SS "Protocols"
The supported protocols for the emulation session are listed below.
.TP
.B telnet
Connect to the AS/400 using a normal unencrypted telnet connection.
.B tn5250
is an alias for
.BR telnet .
.TP
.B ssl
Connect securely using an encrypted SSL session. This option is only
available if
.B tn5250
was compiled with SSL support.
.TP
.B debug
Instead of connecting to a server, replay the trace generated by the
.B trace
option.  The path to the trace file should be given instead of the
hostname.
.SS "Translation Maps"
CCSIDs on the AS/400 are listed in Appendix G of IBM manual
SC41-5101-01, AS/400 National Language Support.  This manual is
available on the web at
.RI < http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/cgi\-bin/bookmgr/BOOKS/QB3AWC01/G.2 >.
.PP
Currently recognised values for the translation map are: 37, 256, 273,
277, 278, 280, 284, 285, 290, 297, 420, 424, 500, 870, 871, 875, 880, 905,
and 1026.  Most of these are translated to ISO-8859-1, also known as
Latin 1.  Some of them contain characters only present in another
encoding, which is used instead.  The valid CCSID values, and the Unix
encoding used, are listed below.
