.TH TN5250 1 "12 November 2001"
.SH NAME
tn5250 \- an implementation of the 5250 telnet protocol
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tn5250
.RI [\| OPTIONS \|]
.I HOSTNAME
.br
.B xt5250
.RI [\| OPTIONS \|]
.I HOSTNAME
.br
.B tn5250 \-version
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B tn5250
emulates IBM's 5250 compatible terminals to connect over TCP/IP to an
IBM AS/400.  The terminal emulation works on any local terminal
supported by curses, and provides 132x27 and full colour support where
possible.
.PP
An IBM 5250 terminal supports a number of special keys, and does a lot 
of processing itself before sending data to the host system.  Because
a standard ASCII terminal does not support all these keys,
.B tn5250
uses control sequences to perform the operations.
.PP
Named session support (with the
.B env.DEVNAME
option) is available for most versions of OS/400, but is only supplied
with V4R3 and later versions.  For V3R2, V3R7, V4R1 and V4R2, please
see informational APAR II10918.
.SH OPTIONS
.B tn5250
options are described in the
.BR tn5250rc (5)
man page.
.SH USAGE
This manual assumes that the user is familiar with a real 5250
terminal, or another 5250 emulator, and only describes features
relevant to
.B tn5250
itself.
.SS "Keyboard Mapping"
The following table lists the 5250 functions implemented by
.BR tn5250 ,
and the corresponding keypresses.  Keys are represented as Emacs does:
.B C-a
means hold
.B Ctrl
and press
.BR A ,
.B M-a
means press
.B Esc
or
.B C-g
followed by
.BR A ,
and
.B C-M-a
means press
.B Esc
or
.B C-g
followed by
.BR C-a .
Most setups also let you use the
.B Alt
or
.B Meta
key for
.B M-
keypresses.

.IP 1. 3
Which keys generate f11-f24, backtab, backspace and delete is very
dependent on the configuration of the terminal.
.IP 2.
.B +
and
.B -
only work as Field+ and Field- in signed numeric fields.
.LP
.SS Display
The screen display tries to be the same as a colour 5250 terminal.
There are some unavoidable differences though:
.IP \(bu 3
ASCII terminals (and curses) do not support the 5250 column
separators.
.IP \(bu
Some terminals (mostly ones based on the VGA text mode) do not support
underlining.  If this is the case and
.B tn5250
does not detect it automatically, you should pass the
.B \-u
option.
.IP \(bu
Some terminals (such as
.BR xterm )
do not support blinking text.
.SH EXAMPLES
These are some examples of the use of
.BR tn5250 :
.TP
.I "tn5250 as400sys"
Connect to the system
.IR as400sys ,
using the default translation map (37)
and a generated session name
.RI (QPADEV #### ).
.TP
.I "tn5250 map=870 env.DEVNAME=session1 env.TERM=IBM-3477-FC as400sys"
Connect to
.I as400sys
using the translation map for CCSID 870 (Eastern Europe), the session
name SESSION1 and with a terminal supporting colour and a 132x27
display.
.SH BUGS
Please report any bugs you find to the bug tracker or to the linux5250
mailing list.  See the
.B tn5250
web site for more details.
